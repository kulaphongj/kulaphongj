## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Kulaphong Jitareerat or **YOK**, and this is a glimpse into my projects on GitHub! Here's a quick overview of what I've been working on:

### Projects

#### 1. [Comparative Evaluation of Pretrained Models for Lung Disease Classification from Chest X-Rays](https://github.com/kulaphongj/cnn_lung_diseases?tab=readme-ov-file)
This project investigates the comparative efficacy of various pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) models for classifying lung diseases from chest X-rays. Extending previous research using VGG16, it includes EfficientNetV2 models and evaluates the impact of optimizers like Adam and AdamW. The aim is to enhance diagnostic accuracy across ten lung disease classes and a normal class.

#### 2. [Understanding Diabetes Risk](https://github.com/kulaphongj/diabetes_prediction)
This project analyzes health data from over 250,000 individuals to identify factors that might increase the risk of developing diabetes. By using various machine learning models and statistics, the goal is to understand how personal details and health indicators can predict diabetes risk and inform health policy decisions.

#### 3. [Discover Your Music Taste Dashboard](https://github.com/kulaphongj/spotify_dashboard)
An interactive dashboard that uses Spotify data to help users explore their music preferences. It features advanced data visualizations and customizable filters to uncover new tracks and understand listening habits.

#### 4. [Milk Quality Prediction](https://github.com/kulaphongj/milk_quality_prediction)
This project aims to predict milk quality using various supervised machine-learning techniques. It explores models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine to classify milk based on attributes like pH, temperature, and fat content. The results highlight the Random Forest model's accuracy and insights into feature importance for milk quality prediction.

#### 5. [YelpViz](https://github.com/kulaphongj/yelp_api_wrapper)
YelpViz simplifies the visualization process by retrieving business-related information using Yelp's API and providing plotted charts for analysis.

#### 6. [Quizzer App](https://github.com/kulaphongj/Quizzer)
The Quizzer App is a software package designed to conduct quizzes. It comprises two sub-packages that facilitate the creation and management of quizzes.
